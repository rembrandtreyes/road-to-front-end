# Road to becoming a Fron-End Developer in 2020


Below you will find a series of **FREE** courses and content that will help you on your way to becoming a front-end developer in 2020. If you are like me then you hate google searching for hours trying to find the right courses.

Being a front-end developer means more than just knowing HTML CSS and JavaScript. In todays world you need to know so much more! You need to know how the internet works (yes this is a requirement). How to write HTML style it with CSS and make it come to life with JavaScript. You need to have version control on lock. You will need to know about HTTPs, CORS and other security policies. And that is just scratching the surface of all the different things you need to know. At the beginning of my journey to becoming a front-end developer I was frantically searching for things to study and learn. I am so scattered brained so I decided I need to create a list of things to learn and do them in order.

*Note: At the time of writing this (3/22/2020) all the courses/content listed below are free. Please create an issue if there is a course that is no longer free and I will try to update it with something comprobable. Also if there are courses and content that you find explains things better, please feel free to open a PR and we can get that added!

So without further ado
